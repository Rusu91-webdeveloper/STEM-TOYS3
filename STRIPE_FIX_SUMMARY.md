# Stripe Card Input Fix - Production Issue Resolution

## 🐛 **Problem Description**

In production, the card details input field in the checkout form was not
working - users couldn't type anything in the card input field.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was caused by **Content Security Policy (CSP)** restrictions in
production that were blocking Stripe's scripts from loading properly. The
middleware was using very restrictive CSP directives that prevented:

1. **Stripe scripts from loading** (`js.stripe.com`)
2. **Stripe API connections** (`api.stripe.com`)
3. **Stripe iframe elements** (for secure card input)

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Updated CSP Configuration (middleware.ts)**

- **Added Stripe domains** to `script-src`: `https://js.stripe.com`,
  `https://m.stripe.com`
- **Added Stripe API endpoints** to `connect-src`: `https://api.stripe.com`,
  `https://m.stripe.com`, `https://checkout.stripe.com`
- **Added Stripe iframe sources** to `frame-src`: `https://js.stripe.com`,
  `https://hooks.stripe.com`, `https://checkout.stripe.com`
- **Added HTTPS Stripe images** to `img-src`: `https://stripe.com`

### **2. Enhanced Stripe Initialization (lib/stripe.ts)**

- **Added better error handling** with try-catch blocks
- **Added Stripe configuration options** for better compatibility
- **Added API version specification** (`2023-10-16`)
- **Added beta features support** for latest Stripe functionality

### **3. Improved StripeProvider Component**

- **Added loading states** to show when Stripe is initializing
- **Added error handling** with retry functionality
- **Added proper async loading** with useState and useEffect

### **4. Enhanced StripePaymentForm Component**

- **Added loading state** when Stripe Elements are not ready
- **Added debugging information** to help identify issues
- **Added better error messages** for users

### **5. Added Debug Component**

- **Created StripeDebug component** for development testing
- **Added environment information** display
- **Added Stripe loading status** monitoring

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

✅ **Changes deployed to production** via Git push ✅ **Build completed
successfully** without errors ✅ **All CSP restrictions updated** to allow
Stripe functionality

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **For Development:**

1. The debug component will show in the bottom-right corner
2. Check browser console for Stripe loading messages
3. Verify card input field is functional

### **For Production:**

1. Navigate to `/checkout` page
2. Try entering card details in the payment form
3. Card input should now be fully functional
4. Test with Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

## 🔧 **Key Files Modified**

- `app/middleware.ts` - CSP configuration
- `lib/stripe.ts` - Stripe initialization
- `features/checkout/components/StripeProvider.tsx` - Provider component
- `features/checkout/components/StripePaymentForm.tsx` - Payment form
- `components/debug/StripeDebug.tsx` - Debug component (new)
- `app/checkout/CheckoutContent.tsx` - Added debug component

## 📋 **Environment Variables Required**

Ensure these are set in production:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Stripe public key
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe secret key (for API calls)

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After deployment, users should be able to:

- ✅ Type in the card number field
- ✅ Enter expiry date and CVC
- ✅ Complete payment processing
- ✅ See proper loading states
- ✅ Get helpful error messages if issues occur

## 🔍 **Monitoring**

- Check browser console for any remaining CSP violations
- Monitor Stripe dashboard for successful payments
- Watch for any new error messages in production logs
