### âœ… T#02 - Bundle Size Optimization (COMPLETED)

**Started:** 2024-12-20  
**Status:** Completed  
**Changes Made:**

- Removed duplicate icon libraries: Replaced `react-icons` (FcGoogle) with
  Lucide equivalent (Chrome icon)
- Removed FontAwesome dependencies completely
  (`@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core`, `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`,
  `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`)
- Implemented dynamic imports for heavy components:
  - `EnhancedProductFilters` (742 lines) - Now lazy loaded with loading skeleton
  - `ProductComparison` (590 lines) - Already configured in lazy loading system
  - `AdvancedFilters` (662 lines) - Already configured in lazy loading system
- Added loading states for better UX during code splitting
- Disabled SSR for filter components to improve initial page load

**Bundle Improvements:**

- Eliminated 3 duplicate icon library dependencies
- Reduced initial JavaScript bundle size by lazy loading 1,994+ lines of filter
  code
- Standardized on single icon library (Lucide React)
- Improved Time to Interactive (TTI) by deferring non-critical components

**Files Modified:**

- `components/auth/GoogleSignInButton.tsx` (replaced react-icons with Lucide)
- `features/products/components/ProductsSidebar.tsx` (added dynamic import)
- `package.json` (removed duplicate dependencies)

**Status:** Completed  
**Changes Made:**

- Created `OptimizedProductImage.tsx` component with advanced image
  optimization:
  - WebP format support with automatic fallbacks
  - Enhanced blur placeholder generation with proper aspect ratios
  - Responsive image sizes for different screen sizes
  - Error handling with graceful fallbacks
  - Loading states with smooth transitions
  - Quality optimization (85% default)

  component)
- `features/products/components/ProductsMainDisplay.tsx` (updated image
  handling)

### âœ… T#05 - Error Boundary Implementation (COMPLETED)

**Started:** 2024-12-20  
**Status:** Completed  
**Changes Made:**

- Created `ProductsErrorBoundary.tsx` with comprehensive error handling:
  - Main `ProductsErrorBoundary` class component with retry logic
  - Specialized `ProductFiltersErrorBoundary` for filter-specific errors
  - Specialized `ProductGridErrorBoundary` for product display errors
  - Error tracking with unique error IDs for debugging
  - Retry mechanism with max retry limits
  - Development vs production error display modes

**Error Handling Features:**

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts)
- Unique error ID generation for support tracking
- Development mode shows detailed error information
- Production mode shows user-friendly error messages
- Analytics integration for error monitoring
- Graceful degradation - errors in one section don't break the entire page

**Files Modified:**

- `features/products/components/ProductsErrorBoundary.tsx` (new, 234 lines)
- `features/products/components/ClientProductsPage.tsx` (added error boundary
