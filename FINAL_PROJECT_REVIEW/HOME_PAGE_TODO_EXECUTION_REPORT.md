## ðŸ”§ CI/CD Pipeline Fix

**Issue:** CI/CD pipeline was failing with `npm ci` due to package-lock.json
being out of sync after removing dependencies with pnpm.

**Resolution:** Updated CI/CD pipeline to use pnpm consistently:

- âœ… **Commit:** 8cb4912 - Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- âœ… **Changes:** Replaced all `npm` commands with `pnpm` equivalents
- âœ… **Added:** `pnpm/action-setup@v4` to all jobs
- âœ… **Updated:** Cache strategy from `npm` to `pnpm`
- âœ… **Fixed:** Dependency sync issues between package.json and lock files

**Before/After:**

```yaml
# Before (causing failures)
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci

# After (working)
- name: Install pnpm
  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
  with:
    version: 9
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

**Status:** âœ… Pipeline should now work correctly with pnpm-lock.yaml
