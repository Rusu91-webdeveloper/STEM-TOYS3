   translation keys
4. **Performance Optimization**: Removing artificial delays for immediate user
   feedback

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Component Dependencies**: Managing state and props between extracted
   components
2. **Translation Consistency**: Ensuring all text uses the translation system
3. **Hook Implementation**: Converting component logic to custom hooks
4. **Testing Considerations**: Ensuring extracted components maintain
   functionality

### Best Practices Established

1. **Component Size Limits**: Enforcing 300-line limit for maintainability
2. **Internationalization**: Using translation keys with fallback text
3. **Performance**: Removing artificial delays and optimizing loading
4. **Modularity**: Creating focused, reusable components
