# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting
significant architectural decisions made during the development of the STEM Toys
e-commerce platform.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important
architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help
teams:

- Document the reasoning behind architectural decisions
- Provide context for future developers
- Track the evolution of the system architecture
- Avoid repeating past discussions

## ADR Template

Each ADR follows this template:

```markdown
# ADR-[number]: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or
change?]

## Decision

[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences

[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]

## Alternatives Considered

[What other options were considered?]

## References

[Links to relevant documentation, discussions, or resources]
```

## Architecture Principles

Our architecture is guided by these principles:

1. **Developer Experience**: Tools and patterns that enhance productivity
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
3. **Performance**: Fast loading and responsive user experience
4. **Scalability**: Architecture that grows with the business
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, documented, and testable code
6. **Security**: Built-in security best practices
7. **Accessibility**: Inclusive design for all users

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom Hooks

### Backend

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **File Upload**: UploadThing

### Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Database Hosting**: Neon/PlanetScale
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network
- **Monitoring**: Sentry
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics

### Development Tools

- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Architectural Patterns

### Repository Pattern

- Abstraction layer for data access
- Consistent interface for database operations
- Easy testing and mocking

### Service Layer

- Business logic separation
- Reusable business operations
- Clear separation of concerns

### Event-Driven Architecture

- Loose coupling between components
- Scalable side-effect handling
- Audit trail and debugging capabilities

### Dependency Injection

- Testable code structure
- Flexible service configuration
- Clear dependency management

## Decision Process

When making architectural decisions:

1. **Identify the Problem**: Clearly define what needs to be solved
2. **Research Options**: Investigate available solutions
3. **Create ADR**: Document the decision using the ADR template
4. **Team Review**: Get feedback from the development team
5. **Implementation**: Apply the decision
6. **Monitor**: Track the consequences and adjust if needed

## Contributing to Architecture

To propose an architectural change:

1. Create a new ADR using the template
2. Number it sequentially (next available number)
3. Submit as part of your pull request
4. Include relevant team members in review
5. Update this README with the new ADR
