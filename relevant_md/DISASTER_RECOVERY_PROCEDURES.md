## üóÑÔ∏è Data Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

#### **Scenario 1: Database Corruption**

```bash
# 1. Immediately stop all application instances
vercel --prod env set MAINTENANCE_MODE true

# 2. Assess the damage
# Check database connection and run integrity checks

# 3. Restore from the latest backup
# See backup restoration procedures below

# 4. Verify data integrity
# Run data consistency checks

# 5. Resume operations
vercel --prod env set MAINTENANCE_MODE false
```

#### **Scenario 2: Accidental Data Deletion**

```bash
# 1. IMMEDIATELY stop all write operations
# Set database to read-only mode if possible

# 2. Identify the scope of deletion
# Check logs for the deletion time and affected tables

# 3. Point-in-time recovery
# Restore to a point just before the deletion occurred

# 4. Verify recovered data
# Run queries to confirm data integrity
```

#### **Backup Restoration Steps**

```bash
# 1. Stop application
vercel --prod env set MAINTENANCE_MODE true

# 2. Create current state backup (if possible)
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > emergency_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# 3. List available backups
# Check your backup storage (local/S3/GCS)

# 4. Download and prepare backup
# Decrypt and decompress if necessary

# 5. Restore database
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup_file.sql

# 6. Verify restoration
# Run health checks and data consistency checks

# 7. Resume operations
vercel --prod env set MAINTENANCE_MODE false
```

### File System Recovery

#### **Application Code Recovery**

```bash
# 1. Check Git repository status
git status
git log --oneline -10

# 2. Revert to last known good state
git reset --hard <last_known_good_commit>

# 3. Force deployment
vercel --prod --force

# 4. Verify deployment
curl -I https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

#### **User-Uploaded Content Recovery**

```bash
# 1. Check CDN/Storage service status
# 2. Restore from backup storage
# 3. Update database references if necessary
# 4. Verify file accessibility
```

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Recovery

### Vercel Deployment Issues

#### **Complete Deployment Failure**

```bash
# 1. Check Vercel status
curl -s https://www.vercel-status.com/api/v2/status.json

# 2. Try redeployment
vercel --prod --force

# 3. If deployment fails, check build logs
vercel logs --all

# 4. Rollback to previous deployment
vercel rollback <previous-deployment-url>

# 5. Alternative: Deploy to backup provider
# Use your secondary hosting setup
```

#### **DNS Issues**

```bash
# 1. Check DNS propagation
nslookup your-domain.com
dig your-domain.com

# 2. Verify DNS settings in registrar
# 3. Contact DNS provider if necessary

```

### Database Provider Issues

#### **Database Service Outage**

```bash
# 1. Check provider status page
# 2. Enable read-only mode from backup
# 3. Set up temporary database if needed
# 4. Communicate with users about limited functionality
```

#### **Connection Pool Exhaustion**

```bash
# 1. Restart application instances
vercel --prod env set DATABASE_CONNECTION_LIMIT 10

# 2. Scale down non-essential services
# 3. Implement connection pooling optimizations
# 4. Monitor connection usage
```
