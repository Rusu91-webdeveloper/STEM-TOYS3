You now have full access to my e-commerce project codebase and database schema.
Your task is to design and plan a Supplier Portal page for my STEM toys
e-commerce business in Romania (2025).

Steps:

1. Analyze my existing codebase, components, database models, and architecture.
2. Based on the current design system (Next.js, Tailwind, components already
   built), propose a Supplier Portal that matches world-class standards of UX,
   performance, and security.
3. Ensure the page and system have the following functionality:
   - Public-facing "Become a Supplier/Partner" landing page with a professional
     call-to-action.
   - Supplier registration form (collect: company name, contact info, product
     categories, catalogs, certifications, VAT/Tax info).
   - Supplier authentication system (login/signup).
   - Supplier dashboard to manage: orders, invoices, purchase history, product
     uploads, status updates.
   - Admin approval flow for new suppliers.
   - Integration with existing e-commerce database and order system.
   - Localization: Romanian + English.
   - Performance best practices (lazy loading, optimized queries, caching).
   - Security best practices (input validation, role-based access, encrypted
     sensitive data).

4. After analysis, generate a detailed **Markdown file**
   (`SupplierPortal_Plan.md`) with the following sections:
   - **Overview**: Purpose of the Supplier Portal and how it integrates with the
     store.
   - **UI/UX Design Plan**: Layout, navigation, responsive considerations,
     branding alignment.
   - **Database/Backend Plan**: Tables, relationships, API endpoints, supplier
     workflow logic.
   - **Frontend Plan**: Components, forms, dashboards, charts, notifications.
   - **Security & Performance**: Authentication, RBAC, caching, monitoring.
   - **Implementation Roadmap**: Step-by-step milestones to build and deploy.
   - **Future Extensions**: AI-assisted catalog management, automated invoice
     reconciliation, supplier analytics.

Important: Only generate the `.md` file **after** you have analyzed the codebase
and database. The plan must reflect my current system’s structure, naming
conventions, and architecture — not generic boilerplate.

Output:  
Generate one Markdown file with the exact plan: `SupplierPortal_Plan.md`.
