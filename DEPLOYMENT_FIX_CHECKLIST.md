# Deployment Fix Checklist

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ CORS API URL Issue

**Problem**: Admin dashboard was trying to call localhost API endpoints from
production (CORS error) **Fix**: Updated API calls to use `getApiUrl()` utility
function that properly handles environment-based URLs

**Key Files Modified**:

- `app/lib/admin/api.ts` - Dashboard API calls
- `lib/admin/api.ts` - Client-side API calls
- `app/admin/analytics/components/ClientAnalytics.tsx` - Analytics API calls

**Environment Variables Required**:

```bash
# Primary (recommended)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="https://stem-toys-3.vercel.app"

# Alternatives (in order of preference)
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://stem-toys-3.vercel.app"
VERCEL_URL="stem-toys-3.vercel.app"  # Automatically set by Vercel
```

### 2. ✅ Admin Products Caching Issue

**Problem**: Admin products page showing stale data after create/delete
operations **Fix**: Added proper cache invalidation with `revalidatePath()` and
`force-dynamic` export

**Key Files Modified**:

- `app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Added `force-dynamic` and `revalidate = 0`
- `app/api/admin/products/route.ts` - Added `revalidatePath("/admin/products")`
- `app/api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts` - Added
  `revalidatePath("/admin/products")`

## Environment Variables Setup

### For Vercel Deployment

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project settings
3. Add the following environment variable:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL = https://stem-toys-3.vercel.app
   ```

### For Local Development

Your `.env.local` file should contain:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Admin Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to `/admin`
   - Verify no CORS errors in browser console
   - Dashboard should load successfully

2. **Test Admin Products**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/products`
   - Create a new product
   - Verify it appears immediately in the list
   - Delete a product
   - Verify it disappears immediately from the list

3. **Test Analytics**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/analytics`
   - Change the time period dropdown
   - Verify no CORS errors and data loads correctly

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ No CORS errors in browser console
- ✅ Admin dashboard loads data correctly
- ✅ Product changes are reflected immediately
- ✅ Analytics data loads without errors
- ✅ All API calls use correct domain (not localhost)

## Backup Plan

If issues persist, the `getApiUrl()` function has a hardcoded fallback:

```typescript
// Production fallback - Your actual domain
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  return "https://stem-toys-3.vercel.app";
}
```

This ensures the app will work even if environment variables are not set
correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes
2. Test the admin dashboard functionality
3. Monitor for any remaining CORS errors
4. Verify that product management works correctly
5. Test the analytics dashboard
