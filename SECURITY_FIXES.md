# Security Fixes Implementation

This document outlines the security fixes implemented to address the vulnerabilities identified in the security audit report.

## 1. Removal of Hardcoded Credentials

### Issue:

Hardcoded credentials were found in several files across the codebase, including:

- `lib/auth.ts`: Contained hardcoded test users with password hashes
- `prisma/seed.ts`: Contained hardcoded admin credentials
- `prisma/seed-direct.js`: Contained hardcoded admin credentials
- `scripts/create-test-return.js`: Contained hardcoded user data and password

### Fix Implemented:

- Created a secure admin seeding mechanism that uses environment variables
- Added the `seed:admin` script to `package.json` for easy admin user creation
- Removed all hardcoded mock users from `lib/auth.ts`
- Updated all seed files to use environment variables with fallbacks
- Created proper documentation for setting up admin users securely
- Modified scripts to generate secure password hashes from environment variables
- Configured scripts to prioritize `.env.local` over `.env` for better security

### Files Modified:

- `/lib/auth.ts`
- `/prisma/seed-admin.ts` (new file)
- `/prisma/seed.ts`
- `/prisma/seed-direct.js`
- `/scripts/create-test-return.js`
- `/package.json`

## 2. Environment Variables Setup

- Created an environment variables structure that follows security best practices
- Implemented fallbacks for development purposes while ensuring security
- Added validation in scripts to check for required environment variables
- Ensured sensitive information is only stored in environment variables, not in code
- **Added support for `.env.local` files**, which take priority over `.env` files (recommended for local development)

## 3. Usage Instructions

### To Create an Admin User:

1. Set up the following environment variables in a `.env.local` file (preferred) or `.env` file:

```
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@example.com"
ADMIN_NAME="Admin User"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
```

2. Run the admin seeding script:

```bash
npm run seed:admin
```

## 4. Security Best Practices Implemented

- **Environment-Based Configuration**: All sensitive data moved to environment variables
- **Secure Password Handling**: Proper password hashing with bcrypt
- **Validation**: Checking for required environment variables before operations
- **Fallbacks**: Safe defaults for non-sensitive values while requiring sensitive ones to be explicitly set
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for secure deployment and usage
- **Local Environment Prioritization**: Scripts now prioritize `.env.local` over `.env` for better security practices
