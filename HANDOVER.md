# NextCommerce Project Handover

This document outlines the process for packaging and distributing the NextCommerce project for handover to clients or other developers.

## Project Structure Overview

The NextCommerce project follows a feature-first organization pattern with Next.js App Router conventions:

```
nextcommerce/
├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
│   ├── api/             # API routes
│   ├── (routes)/        # Application routes
├── components/          # Shared UI components
├── features/            # Feature-specific code
│   ├── auth/            # Authentication
│   ├── cart/            # Shopping cart
│   ├── checkout/        # Checkout process
│   ├── products/        # Product catalog
│   └── ...
├── lib/                 # Utility functions and shared code
├── prisma/              # Database schema and migrations
├── public/              # Static assets
└── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Key Documentation Files

Ensure the following documentation files are included and up-to-date before handover:

1. **README.md** - Project overview and basic setup instructions
2. **SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Detailed instructions for setting up the project locally
3. **ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md** - Documentation of all environment variables
4. **TASKS.md** - Completed and pending tasks (for development team)
5. **env.example** - Example environment variables file (without sensitive values)

## Packaging Process

### 1. Clean the Project

Remove unnecessary files and build artifacts:

```bash
# Remove node_modules and build directories
npm run clean

# OR manually
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf .next
```

### 2. Ensure Git History is Clean (Optional)

If you want to include Git history:

```bash
# Remove large files from Git history
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf path/to/large/files' HEAD

# Clean up Git repository
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
```

### 3. Create the Package

#### Option A: ZIP Archive

```bash
# Create a ZIP archive excluding node_modules and other unnecessary files
zip -r nextcommerce.zip . -x "node_modules/*" ".next/*" ".git/*" "*.env*"
```

#### Option B: Git Archive

```bash
# Create a clean archive from Git
git archive --format=zip HEAD -o nextcommerce.zip
```

#### Option C: GitHub Release

Create a GitHub release with tags for versioning:

1. Tag the release:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. Create a release on GitHub with notes about features and changes

### 4. Include Database Schema and Seed Data

Ensure the database schema and seed data are included:

```bash
# Export database schema
npx prisma db pull > database_schema.prisma

# Export seed data (if applicable)
pg_dump -U postgres -d nextcommerce --data-only --inserts > seed_data.sql
```
