# Recent Security Updates

This document outlines recent security enhancements implemented in the STEM Toys platform to address specific security recommendations.

## 1. Distributed Rate Limiting with Redis

### Issue Addressed

- **In-Memory Rate Limiting**: Previously, the application used an in-memory rate limiting mechanism which is not suitable for distributed environments or deployments with multiple instances.

### Solution Implemented

- **Redis-Based Rate Limiting**: Implemented a distributed rate limiting system using Redis for more robust protection
- **Graceful Fallback**: Maintained the in-memory rate limiting as a fallback if Redis is unavailable
- **Consistent Headers**: Preserved the same rate limit headers and error responses for API compatibility

### Security Benefits

- **Distributed Protection**: Rate limits are now enforced across all application instances
- **Shared State**: Rate limit counters persist even if an application instance restarts
- **Scalability**: Solution scales with the application as more instances are added
- **Resilience**: Fallback mechanism ensures rate limiting continues to function even if Redis is temporarily unavailable

## 2. Enhanced Password Security

### Issue Addressed

- **Insufficient Work Factor**: The application was using a bcrypt work factor of 10, which is adequate but could be improved for better security against brute-force attacks.

### Solution Implemented

- **Increased Work Factor**: Raised the bcrypt work factor from 10 to 12 across all password hashing operations:
  - User registration
  - Password reset flows
  - Admin account creation
  - Profile password updates
  - Database seeding scripts

### Security Benefits

- **Stronger Password Hashing**: Work factor of 12 makes password cracking significantly more computationally expensive
- **Future-Proofing**: Provides better protection against advances in hardware capabilities
- **Balanced Security**: Offers strong security while maintaining reasonable performance for authentication

## Implementation Details

These security improvements were implemented with minimal disruption to existing functionality:

1. **No Database Changes Required**: Updates were made to code only, not requiring migrations
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing hashed passwords remain valid
3. **No API Changes**: All endpoints maintain the same interface and behavior
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Security improves as users change passwords and new users register

## Next Steps

To further enhance the application's security posture, consider:

1. **Implement Virus Scanning for Uploaded Files**: Add malware detection for all file uploads
2. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule periodic security reviews of the codebase and dependencies
3. **Consider Increasing Work Factor Further**: As hardware capabilities improve, consider increasing the work factor to 13 or higher in the future
4. **Password Policy Enforcement**: Implement more sophisticated password strength requirements
