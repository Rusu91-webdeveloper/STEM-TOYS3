## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Risk: Exposure of sensitive user data or admin access
   - Mitigation: Implementation of secure authentication, password hashing, standardized authorization checks, and regular security audits

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Risk: Slow page loads or API responses affecting user experience
   - Mitigation: Implementation of caching strategies, optimized database queries, and image optimization

3. **Payment Processing Failures**
   - Risk: Failed payments or transaction errors
